wizehiver is currently a **work in progress**.

The Zengine API, created by WizeHive, is a cloud-based platform that can organize the collection, review, and management of data and applications for grants and other business processes. The goal of wizehiver is to build functionality to:

1. Input and manage Zengine RESTful API tokens
2. Get available API resources
3. Process API response content into analysis-ready tibbles

The wizehiver package has no relationship or affiliation with, sponsorship, or endorsement by WizeHive.

## Installation

You can install the development version of wizehiver from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ivelasq/wizehiver")
```

## Setup

### Get and store the API key

Generate a Zengine API personal access token from your [Zengine account page](https://platform.zenginehq.com/account/developer).

wizehiver functions will read your Zengine API personal access token or key from the environment variable `ZENGINE_PAT` stored in `.Renviron`.

If `ZENGINE_PAT` is not stored in `.Renviron`, you will be prompted to edit it. You can also edit `.Renviron` by calling the function `set_token()` or `set_key()` directly.

To verify your access token or key is stored in `.Renviron`, use function `get_token()` or `get_key()`.

## Usage

### Get massive Zengine API JSON response

To obtain the Zengine API data, use `get_zen()`. Common choices include "forms" and "workspaces". A full list of resources is available [here](https://zenginehq.github.io/developers/rest-api/resources/).
